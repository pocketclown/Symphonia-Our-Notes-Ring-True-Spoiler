Hello! This is the README section of my custom magic set, "Symphonia, Our Notes Ring True!"
[RULES HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOT-idBz3QjvQT8cHz5KaOJcZlWOo7yPBTImZDM9JMA/edit?usp=sharing)
[Card Set Spoiler](https://pocketclown.github.io/Symphonia-Our-Notes-Ring-True-Spoiler/)

All cards can be looked at individually in the TTS Import folder! It also has the raw card data for the MSE Importer Tool for TTS. 

Any art currently on cards are not official release art. They are placeholders until the set is finished. 

If you playtest this set and have critiques, comments, or suggestions you can contact me on discord @ autumnclown!
