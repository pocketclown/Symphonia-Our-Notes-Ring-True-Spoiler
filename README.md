Hello! This is the README section of my custom magic set, "Symphonia, Our Notes Ring True!"
[RULES HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vOT-idBz3QjvQT8cHz5KaOJcZlWOo7yPBTImZDM9JMA/edit?usp=sharing)
[Card Set Spoiler](https://pocketclown.github.io/Symphonia-Our-Notes-Ring-True/)

All cards can be looked at individually in the TTS Import folder! It also has the raw card data for the MSE Importer Tool for TTS. 

Any art currently on cards are not official release art. They are placeholders until the set is finished. 

If you playtest this set and have critiques, comments, or suggestions you can contact me on discord @ autumnclown! 

You can try it out by subscribing to my [TTS Workshop Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3673442123).
All you need to do is load up the table with the decklist, select the entire deck, and add to saved objects! 

Making a deck list with these cards coming soon... Once I figure out how best to do it....
